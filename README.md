# Simon-Game

The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds as they get longer and more complex. 

It's a great way to challenge your memory and concentration skills. 

Typically, Simon consists of four colored buttons: red, green, blue, and yellow. 

The game starts with a random sequence of lights and sounds, and players have to repeat that sequence correctly. 

If they succeed, the game adds another step to the sequence. 

If they fail, the game ends. 

It's simple yet addictive! If you want to play, I'm ready!
